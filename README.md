# Hi there👋
<!--<h3 align="center"> A DATA SCIENCE & AI TECH ENTHUSIAST<b></h3>-->

I have finally discovered my Github profile. I'm from non-coder background. As a Working Professional in data analyst I had used Ms Excel tool for Exploratory Data Analysis & Visuallization. 
To Enter in Artificial intelligence & Data Science field i had started coding with pandas in python IDLE with the help of Youtube, NPTEL(IIT) & Data Science Community website to see whether i could be able to do the same through Coding or not. And I did it Easily then I decided to learn Core Python first & I joined Python Taining at Anna University, Chennai dated on Nov 19 for the month on Weekly Classes.
And after that I have started with Numpy, Pandas & Completed the certification in,
 
- Deep Learning @ CDAC Thiruvananthapuram
- Applied Data Science With Python @ Cognitive Class(IBM)
- Machine Learning With Python @ Cognitive Class(IBM)
 
<h3 align="center"><i>Now I Love Coding!😊Keep Learning👨‍🎓️️</i></h3>
